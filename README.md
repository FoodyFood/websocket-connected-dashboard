# Websocket Connected Dashboard

This is just a site to demonstrate connecting to a websocket and parsing it's JSON response to a friend.

This dashboard connects to a websocket, fetches a campaign, parses it out, and displays it.

The 'apply' button is fake, but all we would do is add a seciton that sends a new json block back to through the websocket formatted the same way as the original one was.
